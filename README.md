# NutanixKarbon

Performing a Karbon demo shouldn't be hard. Anyone can do this. In fact, that's the point behind Karbon, it's so easy, anyone can demo it. You don't have to be an expert.

# What do I do???
Too easy. Go through the motions of creating a cluster:
	- Select Development Cluster
	- Ensure that you select the cluster you want to deploy to
	- Select the Node Network that has internet access
	- Inform the client that Flannel is the default network provider for Karbon's internal communication
	- Very important to put in your cluster login information

After creation, download a new KubeConfig file. Understand that this is only live for 24 hours and will need to be redownloaded.
